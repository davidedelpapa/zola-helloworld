- **Demo: [https://hello-zola.netlify.app/](https://hello-zola.netlify.app/)**
- **Tutorial: [dev.to](https://dev.to/davidedelpapa/zola-tutorial-how-to-use-zola-the-rust-based-static-site-generator-for-your-next-small-project-and-deploy-it-on-netlify-375n)**

## Usage

Follow the tutorial

If you want to see it in action:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidedelpapa/zola-helloworld.git
cd zola-helloworld
zola serve
```

## Requirements

We need Zola, of course.

We could use various means to install Zola.

The fastest way to do it is to get the executable from [https://github.com/getzola/zola/releases](https://github.com/getzola/zola/releases)

We have to unzip it and move it in a folder reachable in our `$PATH`, for example, `~/.local/bin`

```bash
mv zola ~/.local/bin/zola
```
